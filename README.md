Image Swapper
=============

Addon for Blender to swap the image used in a texture in a way that you can animate it.
This addon was originally developed for "Joana", a short project part of the Detail Library animation.

See some final shots of the project here:

How to Use It
-------------
Imagine you have 3 textures of a fish walking cycle animation. Blender has no built-in tool to animate the
image sequence unless you want to play them one at a time, one every frame (using the *Image Sequence* option).

You start by loading the image in a material texture as you would normally. The file should have a numeration (e.g., **fish_001.png**).
This addon creates a new panel where you can animate which frame to use (in our case which of the three slides of the fish).

With this setup you can even use the Graph Editor to animate the slides, create loops, ...

The **samples** folder contains examples of the addon being used. You need to install the addon in order to test the files.
